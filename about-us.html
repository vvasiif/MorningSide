                    We strive to create a fertile, safe atmosphere that
                    promotes and
                    facilitates life-long love for learning and knowledge;
                    curiosity,
                    respect and love for nature (inner and outer), humanity
                    and life,
                    peaceful coexistence, acceptance and reverence for all
                    living
                    things. We aspire to achieve excellence in education
                    within a
                    learning environment that is not bound within the
                    classroom, it is
                    hands-on and child-directed. We aim to educate the whole
                    child
                    through a comprehensive education that cultivates
                    self-directed
                    action, flexible thinking, creativity, and
                    non-standardized models
                    of problem-solving. In this atmosphere we can
                    <span id="dots">...</span>
                    <span id="more">prepare students to face the challenges
                        of an ever-changing
                        world. Our mission is to cultivate the full talents
                        and potentials
                        of each unique child in a holistically caring
                        environment under
                        the guiding principles of the Montessori approach.
                        Our work is
                        informed and inspired by the fields of psychology,
                        psychoanalysis,
                        and contemporary educational research and practices.
                        At
                        Morningside Montessori Elementary we address the
                        emotional,
                        intellectual, physical and social development of
                        each child, in a
                        secure and nurturing way. Creative problem solving
                        and
                        groundbreaking thinking are enhanced. Each child is
                        viewed and
                        treated as the individual she or he is: with
                        different interests,
                        learning styles, abilities, gifts, strengths,
                        potential and
                        talents that need to be discovered, enhanced and
                        invested in. With
                        respect and individualized attention, each child can
                        become an
                        independent, self-aware, self-disciplined and
                        self-motivated
                        learner and global citizen of the world. Morningside
                        Montessori
                        Elementary welcomes and is equipped to educate and
                        assist children
                        with atypical development who are high-functioning.
                        At the present
                        moment there is a large social gap in Cyprus, since
                        the
                        educational and psychological needs of these
                        children are largely
                        under-served and many times go undiagnosed and are
                        not addressed.
                        This fragile population’s needs are accommodated and
                        underscored
                        by our philosophy and practices. We believe that
                        creating an
                        education environment that understands and addresses
                        the demands
                        of each individual child explicitly implies the
                        needs to include
                        and cater to atypical populations. In welcoming
                        gifted and
                        talented students, and those with high-functioning
                        atypical
                        development we provide an educational opportunity
                        not only to
                        these underserved populations, but to all children
                        who deserve to
                        learn about differences in a constructive and
                        inclusive way. Our
                        school aims to promote grass root changes in Cypriot
                        society
                        towards peace and genuine egalitarian dialogue
                        between future
                        citizens of this country. At the heart of all of our
                        programs is
                        peace education, one of the foundations of the
                        Montessori
                        approach. As a country with conflict in its past,
                        cultural
                        integration for our new generation can offer hope
                        not only for
                        Cyprus but for the Middle East. From small
                        interpersonal conflict,
                        to larger instances of bias and bullying, educating
                        for conflict
                        resolution as well as for acceptance of differences
                        is a
                        cornerstone of our philosophy. We believe that we
                        must embrace
                        each other with empathy, in order to promote a
                        culture of peace.
                        It is for this reason that it is imperative to learn
                        and
                        understand each other’s language. Morningside
                        Montessori
                        Elementary is the first primary school of the
                        country, where all
                        three languages (Greek, Turkish and English) are
                        embraced and

                        <p>With the opening of the school and its accreditation from the Ministry of
                            Education we created awareness about Montessori. This journey has exceeded
                            our expectations as we started as a small school of 17 students and now five
                            years later more and more people are interested in Montessori education and
                            the Montessori method. Each year we have more families interested in joining
                            our school and becoming part of our Montessori community. Our goal for the
                            near future is to move into new premises, in which Morningside will have the
                            opportunity to thrive as a learning community. Relocating in premises that
                            are in proximity with the city centre but located in the outskirts in an
                            area surrounded by nature, will give unlimited possibilities for outdoor
                            learning, which is one of the basic pillars of Montessori pedagogy. Our new
                            premises will allow us to accommodate our growing school community in a safe
                            and nurturing environment.</p>
